# TensorFlow study projects
I'll use this repo to store my TensorFlow study projects. I'm following here the instructions from the Udemy's "TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course.

## Project 1 - Fundamentals
1. Reviewing concepts of tensor: creation of *scalar*, *vector* and *matrix* tensors with **tf.constant** and **tf.Variable**;
2. Tensor attributes: shape, rank, index, size;

## Project 2 - Image Generator
1. Using StableDiffusion model within **KerasCV** to generate images from the natural language descriptions (text-to-image).
